					<h1>Directional Solvent Vapour Annealing Process Optimization</h1>

					<h1 id="introduction">Introduction:</h1>
					<p>
						There is an escalating electronic waste crisis fueled by the short
						lifespan of conventional electronic products and the need for
						sustainable and eco-friendly alternatives has over the years become
						extremely crucial. Organic electronics is a class of electronics
						that mostly comprise of materials that organic in nature as they
						provide several benefits in terms of being eco-friendly and
						non-toxic in terms of human interactions. They present
						characteristics such as flexibility, low cost, and scalability.
					</p>
					<p>
						This project embarks on the optimization of fabrication processes
						for Organic Field-Effect Transistors (OFETs). Major objectives of
						the project include improving electrical performance of the OFETs by
						varying pre-decided factors that may affect the performance. Further
						integrate nature-oriented materials and biodegradability.
					</p>
					<p>
						This project undertakes a parameter optimization study on a previous
						paper introducing a novel techniques for creating crystals with
						certain alignment using Directional Solvent Vapor Annealing(DSVA).
						In DSVA for crystal alignment in solution-processed organic
						semiconductors is proposed. The drop-cast technique is enhanced
						using this postprocessing scheme of the solvent vapor annealing with
						additional alignment of the crystals.

					<h3 id="structures">Structures</h3>
					<p>
						Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) are active electronic
						components that can be printed and used in analog, digital, and
						mixed-signal circuits. They can also be used as stand-alone sensors
						where the change in electrical current can be mapped to the physical
						change being sensed . OTFTs are composed of three main components:
						contacts (source (S), drain (D), and gate (G)), a dielectric thin
						film, and an organic semiconducting thin film (OSC). Contacts are
						typically made of silver, gold, copper, or ITO. However, there are
						no standards or trends for dielectrics or organic semiconducting
						material due to the many options and combinations available. The
						components of an OTFT can be ordered into four different structures:
						Bottom Gate Top Contact (BGTC), Bottom Gate Bottom Contact (BGBC),
						Top Gate Bottom Contact (TGBC), and Top Gate Top Contact (TGTC).
						Both BGTC and TGBC are considered staggered transistors due to their
						structure, while BGBC and TGTC are considered coplanar transistors
						for the same reason . Figure 1 shows the four different structures
						of OTFTs.

					<h3 id="operating-principles">Operating Principles</h3>
					<p>
						In both Organic thin-film transistors(OTFTs) and traditional silicon
						metal-oxide semiconductor field0effect transistors(MOSFETs), the
						operating principles share similarities. OTFTs the same as MOSFETs
						involve source and drain electrodes directly contacting the
						semiconductor with the gate contact insulated from the the
						semiconductor by a dielectric film. Applying a voltage bias between
						the gate and source electrodes (VGS) leads to carrier accumulation
						near the semiconductor-dielectric interface, creating a channel for
						current flow when a voltage bias is applied between the drain and
						source (VDS). The minimum VGS required for channel creation is
						called the threshold voltage (Vth).
					</p>
					<p>
						The primary difference between OTFTs and MOSFETs lies in the channel
						formation process. MOSFETs undergo an inversion process, resulting
						in charge carriers in the channel opposite to those in the
						semiconductor bulk. In OTFTs, the charge carriers in the channel are
						same as those in the organic semiconductor (OSC) bulk.
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite the differences in the type of charge transport in organic
						and inorganic semiconductors, OTFTs exhibit similar regions of
						operation to MOSFETs, including cut-off, linear, and saturation.
						When <span class="math inline">\(|V_{GS}|\)</span> is lower than
						<span class="math inline">\(|V_{th}|\)</span>, the transistor is in
						cut-off, with no charge accumulation or channel formation, and thus,
						no current conduction. The linear region starts when
						<span class="math inline">\(|V_{GS}| \geq |V_{th}|\)</span> and
						<span class="math inline"
							>\((|V_{DS}| &lt; |V_{GS} - V_{th}|)\)</span
						>, behaving like a variable resistor. In the saturation region,
						reached at
						<span class="math inline"
							>\(|V_{DS}| \geq |V_{GS}| - |V_{th}|\)</span
						>, the channel undergoes pinch-off, and the current saturates
						following Equation (1-2), where
						<span class="math inline">\(\mu_{Sat}\)</span> is carrier charge
						mobility in the saturation regime.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="math display"
							>\[I_{DS} = \mu_{Lin} C_{g} \frac{W}{L} \left( V_{GS} - V_{th} -
							\frac{V_{DS}}{2} \right) V_{DS}\]</span
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="math display"

							\right)^2\]</span

					<p>
						The fundamental operation of an OTFT involves utilizing the
						capacitor principle, generating an electric field in the dielectric
						in response to a gate-source voltage (<span class="math inline"
							>\(V_{GS}\)</span
						>). This voltage creates an accumulation of holes or electrons by
						aligning the Fermi level of the metal electrodes with the highest
						occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or lowest unoccupied molecular
						orbital (LUMO) energy levels of p-type or n-type organic
						semiconductors (OSCs). The energy diagram shows this concept, with a
						positive <span class="math inline">\(V_{GS}\)</span> resulting in
						insufficient electron injection and a small leakage current, while a
						reversed gate voltage injects holes and forms a positively charged
						channel, classifying the OSC as p-type.

					<h3 id="characteristics">Characteristics:</h3>
					<p>
						Several key parameters determine the performance of an organic
						transistor, and these include field-dependent mobility (<span
							class="math inline"
							>\(\mu\)</span
						>), threshold voltage (<span class="math inline">\(V_{th}\)</span>),
						on/off current ratio (<span class="math inline"
							>\(I_{ON}/I_{OFF}\)</span
						>), and sub-threshold slope (SS). Various factors, such as device
						geometry, material choices in different layers, grain size of the
						organic semiconductor thin film, structural dimensions, and
						semiconductor morphology, can impact these parameters. Achieving
						superior performance in organic transistors requires high mobility,
						low threshold voltage, a large on/off current ratio, and a steep
						sub-threshold slope, all of which are essential for optimal
						functionality.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong
									>Mobility (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>):</strong
								>
								Device mobility measures the efficiency of charge carrier
								movement along the conducting path, representing the average
								drift velocity of charge carriers per unit electric field. High
								mobility is particularly crucial for achieving a high
								on-current, a fundamental requirement for superior performance.
							</p>
						</li>

							<p>
								<strong
									>Threshold Voltage (<span class="math inline">\(V_{th}\)</span

								>
								The threshold voltage is a critical parameter determining the
								switching behavior of a device. It signifies the minimum gate
								voltage required to accumulate charge carriers at the interface
								between the organic semiconductor and the insulator, forming a
								conductive path between the source and the drain.
								<span class="math inline">\(V_{th}\)</span> significantly

								<strong
									>On/Off Current Ratio (<span class="math inline"
										>\(I_{ON}/I_{OFF}\)</span
									>):</strong
								>
								The on/off current ratio, or current ratio in accumulation mode
								to depletion mode, is a crucial parameter for evaluating organic
								transistor performance. A high dielectric constant of the
								insulator, a thin semiconductor layer, and a low doping
								concentration contribute to creating a significant difference
								between on and off current. This parameter measures the device’s
								ability to turn on and off, serving as an important metric for
								assessing its suitability for various applications.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong>Sub-threshold Slope (SS):</strong> Sub-threshold slope
								(SS) gauges the change in drain current on a logarithmic scale
								concerning the change in gate biasing. It reflects impurity
								concentration, interface state, and trap density, influencing
								the switching behavior of a transistor. SS is a crucial
								parameter for evaluating the efficiency of a transistor as a
								switch, determined by the ratio of the change in gate biasing to
								the change in drain current on a logarithmic scale. It plays a
								key role in determining the device’s suitability for various
								applications.

					<h3 id="experimental-setup">Experimental Setup</h3>
					<p>
						The DSVA setup was specially designed and built to perform both
						deposition and postprocessing. The schematic diagram in Figure 4
						illustrates the setup, comprising three zones: fusion, directive,
						and interaction. The fusion zone features a glass vessel filled with
						a solvent at the bottom, heated by a hot plate. The vessel has two
						inlets for solvent and carrier gas. At the top of the fusion zone,
						there is a chamber with an inlet for pushing the gas-vapor mixture
						into the directive zone. This is where the solvent vapor is
						generated, mixed with the carrier gas, and propelled into the
						directive zone.
					</p>
					<p>
						The directive zone is a hollow rectangular chamber with very low
						height, providing high directionality to the gas-vapor mixture. The
						mixture flows continuously from the fusion zone to the interaction
						zone. In the interaction zone, there is a long and narrow tube with
						a stage that can be adjusted to place the samples at different
						positions. The interaction between the gas-vapor mixture and the
						substrate with the solution takes place in this zone. The tube has a
						removable door at the end for inserting or removing samples, and a
						small vent at the top for gas discharge. Figure 5 presents the
						cross-sectional view of the tube, indicating different parameters.
						<span class="math inline">\(h_{c,i}\)</span> is the height of the

						<span class="math inline">\(d_{s,i}\)</span> is the distance of the

						Conclusions of the Initial Study
					</h3>
					<p>
						DSVA is a proposed solution processing technique for organic
						semiconductors that combines SVA and gas flow. DSVA improves the
						molecular self-assembly and alignment of the semiconductor films by
						using SVA and gas−vapor mixture, respectively. The degree of
						crystallinity and alignment of the semiconducting ribbons depends on
						the flow rate of the carrier gas and the position of the substrate
						in the interaction tube. The optimal conditions for DSVA produce a
						semiconducting layer with well-aligned and interconnected ribbons.
						Such a layer leads to a high performance of the OFETs, suggesting
						that DSVA is a versatile technique for solution processing of
						organic semiconductors.
					</p>
					<div class="flushright">
						<p><strong>Background and Problem Statement</strong></p>
					</div>
					<h1 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h1>
					<p>
						The escalating global issue of electronic waste demands a shift
						towards sustainable alternatives. While high performance organic
						electronics particularly Organic Field-Effect Transistors(OFETs)
						show promise, their performance is still not at par with traditional
						inorganic electronics. The task that needs to be undertaken is that
						we need to seamlessly integrate high performance and
						eco-friendliness while navigating through complex procedures such as
						material selection and fabrication processes and produce OFETs that
						are air-stable and biodegradable in nature.
					</p>
					<p>
						One Technique that is used to create OFETs is drop casting the
						organic semiconductor on your substrates however even though this
						technique has shown promise but this technique doesn’t take into
						account the need for alignment of crystals or the elongation of
						crystals. Hence another novel technique can be used post
						drop-casting that uses Directional Solvent Vapor Annealing or DSVA.
						However, since DSVA is a novel technique and there is lack of
						research on several parameters that may or may not affect the
						techniques’ outcomes. So, there is a need for a parameter
						optimization study that varies several relevant parameters and
						reports the outcomes.
					</p>
					<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
					<p>
						Organic semiconductor solution-processing methods are gaining
						attention for their cheaper production costs and eco-friendly
						nature, aiming to compete with complex vacuum processing techniques.
						Factors influencing the performance of solution-processed devices
						include crystallinity, molecular packing, morphology, and
						orientation of crystalline domains. The main challenge in
						solution-processed semiconductors arises from three-dimensional
						crystal growth, leading to inconsistent charge transport and device
						behavior.
					</p>
					<p>
						Common methods like drop casting and spin coating present a
						trade-off between molecular settlement time and crystallinity,
						impacting uniformity and consistency in device performance.
						Alternative processing and post-processing methods, such as zone
						casting, dip coating, and inkjet printing, have been explored to
						control molecular self-assembly and enhance crystalline order.
						Incorporating post-processing methods like solvent vapor annealing
						(SVA) has proven advantageous for improving self-organization and
						crystalline order in semiconductor films.
					</p>
					<p>
						The proposed directional solvent vapor annealing (DSVA) integrates
						deposition and post-processing, aiming to achieve highly aligned and
						crystalline films for high-performance organic semiconductor
						devices. DSVA involves the flow of a carrier gas and solvent vapors
						in a specific direction and proximity to the substrate, promoting
						macroscopic alignment and microscopic molecular self-assembly in
						crystalline domains.
					</p>
					<p>
						Parameters like carrier gas flow rate, substrate proximity, and
						position in the interaction tube critically affect overall
						crystallinity, alignment, and device performance. DSVA application
						in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) fabrication demonstrated
						a maximum mobility of
						<span class="math inline"
							>\(0.86 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{V} \cdot \text{s}\)</span
						>
						and a high current on-off ratio of
						<span class="math inline">\(10^6\)</span>, showcasing its potential
						for achieving high-performance devices in solution-processed organic
						semiconductors.

						The experimental setup was in dysfunctional state at the start of

					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, There were some issues regarding the cleaning of the
						apparatus as the glass vessel that rests on a hot plate has no big
						enough opening for a proper cleaning and the adhesive did not
						interact well with Iso-propyl alcohol and seem to disintegrate on
						contact. So another way was employed as toluene was used under a
						fume hood and then heated and vapours were allowed to flow from
						inside the glass vessel to the rest of the apparatus hence cleaning
						the entire apparatus. These are pictures of the final apparatus.

						Some Preliminary Experiments
					</h2>
					<p>
						There were some basic questions that arose during the project and
						some basic preliminary experiments without much experimental setup
						were designed to answer those questions.
					</p>
					<p>
						There was one experiment where 2 samples of ITO-PET substrate were
						taken after proper cleaning process and then through Atomic Layer
						Deposition (ALD) Hafnium was deposited on only one of them and then
						6,13-Bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene also known as
						TIPS-Pentacene was drop-casted on both those samples.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then to simulate something like DSVA, Nitrogen gas was passed over
						the samples and to prevent direct flow of the gas over the samples a
						simple cardboard piece was placed. The inferences from the
						experiment included that the only the flow of gas without solvent
						vapors was not responsible for the crystal formation and Hafnium
						provided better crystallinity as compared to sample without Hafnium.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another Experiment was conducted and this experiment included two
						samples based on ITO-PET and one was coated Polystyrene(PS) and then
						TIPS-Pentacene was drop casted on it. And another sample which was
						drop-casted with a pre mixed TIPS-Pentacene and Polystyrene solution
						in Toluene. The sample that was coated with Polystyrene and then
						TIPS-Pentacene showed better crystallinity however the electrical
						characteristics were not tested. In an ideal scenario the
						TIPS-Pentacene and PS mix should have shown phase separation during
						crystal formation.
					</p>
					<h2 id="experiment-design-and-experiment">
						Experiment Design and Experiment
					</h2>
					<p>
						As Part of the Preliminary experimental design prior to a full
						factorial Design of Experiments method to find out factors that seem
						to make a difference for our process. Several Factors like Mixing
						Ratio,Substrate Material,Incline of the sample were varied and then
						the experiment was run as described above with bare minimum air flow
						and Toluene as Solvent heated to 120 °C inside the fume hood. The
						experiment was run Thrice for an hour each time and the film formed
						was observed under a microscope. Since it is already known to us
						height of tube ceiling with respect to the floor of the
						stage,Distance of the midpoint of the sample from the beginning of
						the interaction tube, Flow rate of the carrier gas have effect on
						the film of the sample so these were made constant at 6 mm , (1.5
						inches,4 inches, 6 inches), 0.5L/min.

					<p>
						Two types of substrates were used in the experiment ITO-PET and
						Silicon Wafer. Both of them were cleaned using Iso-propyl
						Alcohol,Acetone and Distilled Water. After which ITO-PET had a
						deposition of Hafnium using Atomic Layer Deposition and Silicon
						Wafer was submerged in 5 mM Octadecyltrichlorosilane(OTS) in Toluene
						for 24 hours.
					</p>
					<h3 id="solution-preparation">Solution Preparation</h3>
					<p>
						A 0.5 wt% solution of TIPS-pentacene in toluene (5 mg/mL) was
						prepared by stirring for 3 h at 65 °C. Along with 0.5 wt% solution
						of Polystyrene in Toluene (5 mg/ml) in a similar manner. The were
						mixed in various ratios such 100% (Pure TIPS-Pentacene) , 25% and
						75% .
					</p>
					<h3 id="experiment">Experiment</h3>
					<p>
						The prepared solutions were drop casted on the samples according to
						a prior experimental design mapping various combination to make it
						easy to identify factor contributions.Then Nitrogen was run through

					<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								The substrate ITO-PET isn’t hydrophilic enough to hold our
								solution in a stable form in front of the Nitrogen gas. So, some
								more surface treatment needs to be done to the ITO-PET for
								better attraction towards the solution.The non-uniform film
								cause short circuits.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The Factor Mixing Ratio has an effect on the quality of the film
								higher concentration provided better quality film with uniform
								crystals and in the end relatively better performance.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The Factor Incline didn’t have a positive effect instead
								resulted in accumulation of the solution at the bottom end not
								being able to form a film on the the sample apart from the very
								bottom
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The Factor Substrate Material Does have an effect as the
								interactions with solution and hydrophobicity of every substrate
								is different and surface treatments also make a difference.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								In respect to prior testing with the apparatus in the original
								paper we know that height of tube ceiling with respect to the
								floor of the stage,Distance of the midpoint of the sample from
								the beginning of the interaction tube, Flow rate of the carrier
								gas,
