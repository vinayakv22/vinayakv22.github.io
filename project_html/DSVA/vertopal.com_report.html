		<h1 id="introduction">Introduction:</h1>
		<p>
			There is an escalating electronic waste crisis fueled by the short
			lifespan of conventional electronic products and the need for sustainable
			and eco-friendly alternatives has over the years become extremely crucial.
			Organic electronics is a class of electronics that mostly comprise of
			materials that organic in nature as they provide several benefits in terms
			of being eco-friendly and non-toxic in terms of human interactions. They
			present characteristics such as flexibility, low cost, and scalability.
		</p>
		<p>
			This project embarks on the optimization of fabrication processes for
			Organic Field-Effect Transistors (OFETs). Major objectives of the project
			include improving electrical performance of the OFETs by varying
			pre-decided factors that may affect the performance. Further integrate
			nature-oriented materials and biodegradability.
		</p>
		<p>
			This project undertakes a parameter optimization study on a previous paper
			introducing a novel techniques for creating crystals with certain
			alignment using Directional Solvent Vapor Annealing(DSVA). In DSVA for
			crystal alignment in solution-processed organic semiconductors is
			proposed. The drop-cast technique is enhanced using this postprocessing
			scheme of the solvent vapor annealing with additional alignment of the
			crystals.

		<h3 id="structures">Structures</h3>
		<p>
			Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) are active electronic components
			that can be printed and used in analog, digital, and mixed-signal
			circuits. They can also be used as stand-alone sensors where the change in
			electrical current can be mapped to the physical change being sensed .
			OTFTs are composed of three main components: contacts (source (S), drain
			(D), and gate (G)), a dielectric thin film, and an organic semiconducting
			thin film (OSC). Contacts are typically made of silver, gold, copper, or
			ITO. However, there are no standards or trends for dielectrics or organic
			semiconducting material due to the many options and combinations
			available. The components of an OTFT can be ordered into four different
			structures: Bottom Gate Top Contact (BGTC), Bottom Gate Bottom Contact
			(BGBC), Top Gate Bottom Contact (TGBC), and Top Gate Top Contact (TGTC).
			Both BGTC and TGBC are considered staggered transistors due to their
			structure, while BGBC and TGTC are considered coplanar transistors for the
			same reason . Figure 1 shows the four different structures of OTFTs.

		<h3 id="operating-principles">Operating Principles</h3>
		<p>
			In both Organic thin-film transistors(OTFTs) and traditional silicon
			metal-oxide semiconductor field0effect transistors(MOSFETs), the operating
			principles share similarities. OTFTs the same as MOSFETs involve source
			and drain electrodes directly contacting the semiconductor with the gate
			contact insulated from the the semiconductor by a dielectric film.
			Applying a voltage bias between the gate and source electrodes (VGS) leads
			to carrier accumulation near the semiconductor-dielectric interface,
			creating a channel for current flow when a voltage bias is applied between
			the drain and source (VDS). The minimum VGS required for channel creation
			is called the threshold voltage (Vth).
		</p>
		<p>
			The primary difference between OTFTs and MOSFETs lies in the channel
			formation process. MOSFETs undergo an inversion process, resulting in
			charge carriers in the channel opposite to those in the semiconductor
			bulk. In OTFTs, the charge carriers in the channel are same as those in
			the organic semiconductor (OSC) bulk.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite the differences in the type of charge transport in organic and
			inorganic semiconductors, OTFTs exhibit similar regions of operation to
			MOSFETs, including cut-off, linear, and saturation. When
			<span class="math inline">\(|V_{GS}|\)</span> is lower than
			<span class="math inline">\(|V_{th}|\)</span>, the transistor is in
			cut-off, with no charge accumulation or channel formation, and thus, no
			current conduction. The linear region starts when
			<span class="math inline">\(|V_{GS}| \geq |V_{th}|\)</span> and
			<span class="math inline">\((|V_{DS}| &lt; |V_{GS} - V_{th}|)\)</span>,
			behaving like a variable resistor. In the saturation region, reached at
			<span class="math inline">\(|V_{DS}| \geq |V_{GS}| - |V_{th}|\)</span>,
			the channel undergoes pinch-off, and the current saturates following
			Equation (1-2), where <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{Sat}\)</span> is
			carrier charge mobility in the saturation regime.

			<span class="math display"

			The fundamental operation of an OTFT involves utilizing the capacitor
			principle, generating an electric field in the dielectric in response to a
			gate-source voltage (<span class="math inline">\(V_{GS}\)</span>). This
			voltage creates an accumulation of holes or electrons by aligning the
			Fermi level of the metal electrodes with the highest occupied molecular
			orbital (HOMO) or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels
			of p-type or n-type organic semiconductors (OSCs). The energy diagram
			shows this concept, with a positive
			<span class="math inline">\(V_{GS}\)</span> resulting in insufficient
			electron injection and a small leakage current, while a reversed gate
			voltage injects holes and forms a positively charged channel, classifying
			the OSC as p-type.

			Several key parameters determine the performance of an organic transistor,
			and these include field-dependent mobility (<span class="math inline"
				>\(\mu\)</span
			>), threshold voltage (<span class="math inline">\(V_{th}\)</span>),
			on/off current ratio (<span class="math inline">\(I_{ON}/I_{OFF}\)</span
			>), and sub-threshold slope (SS). Various factors, such as device
			geometry, material choices in different layers, grain size of the organic
			semiconductor thin film, structural dimensions, and semiconductor
			morphology, can impact these parameters. Achieving superior performance in
			organic transistors requires high mobility, low threshold voltage, a large
			on/off current ratio, and a steep sub-threshold slope, all of which are
			essential for optimal functionality.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>Mobility (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>):</strong>
					Device mobility measures the efficiency of charge carrier movement
					along the conducting path, representing the average drift velocity of

					The threshold voltage is a critical parameter determining the

					organic semiconductor and the insulator, forming a conductive path
					between the source and the drain.
					<span class="math inline">\(V_{th}\)</span> significantly influences

					The on/off current ratio, or current ratio in accumulation mode to
					depletion mode, is a crucial parameter for evaluating organic
					transistor performance. A high dielectric constant of the insulator, a
					thin semiconductor layer, and a low doping concentration contribute to
					creating a significant difference between on and off current. This
					parameter measures the device’s ability to turn on and off, serving as
					an important metric for assessing its suitability for various
					applications.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>Sub-threshold Slope (SS):</strong> Sub-threshold slope (SS)
					gauges the change in drain current on a logarithmic scale concerning
					the change in gate biasing. It reflects impurity concentration,
					interface state, and trap density, influencing the switching behavior
					of a transistor. SS is a crucial parameter for evaluating the
					efficiency of a transistor as a switch, determined by the ratio of the
					change in gate biasing to the change in drain current on a logarithmic
					scale. It plays a key role in determining the device’s suitability for
					various applications.

			Directional Solvent Vapor Annealing (DSVA)

		<h3 id="experimental-setup">Experimental Setup</h3>
		<p>
			The DSVA setup was specially designed and built to perform both deposition
			and postprocessing. The schematic diagram in Figure 4 illustrates the
			setup, comprising three zones: fusion, directive, and interaction. The
			fusion zone features a glass vessel filled with a solvent at the bottom,
			heated by a hot plate. The vessel has two inlets for solvent and carrier
			gas. At the top of the fusion zone, there is a chamber with an inlet for
			pushing the gas-vapor mixture into the directive zone. This is where the
			solvent vapor is generated, mixed with the carrier gas, and propelled into
			the directive zone.
		</p>
		<p>
			The directive zone is a hollow rectangular chamber with very low height,
			providing high directionality to the gas-vapor mixture. The mixture flows
			continuously from the fusion zone to the interaction zone. In the
			interaction zone, there is a long and narrow tube with a stage that can be
			adjusted to place the samples at different positions. The interaction
			between the gas-vapor mixture and the substrate with the solution takes
			place in this zone. The tube has a removable door at the end for inserting
			or removing samples, and a small vent at the top for gas discharge. Figure
			5 presents the cross-sectional view of the tube, indicating different
			parameters. <span class="math inline">\(h_{c,i}\)</span> is the height of

			Conclusions of the Initial Study
		</h3>
		<p>
			DSVA is a proposed solution processing technique for organic
			semiconductors that combines SVA and gas flow. DSVA improves the molecular
			self-assembly and alignment of the semiconductor films by using SVA and
			gas−vapor mixture, respectively. The degree of crystallinity and alignment
			of the semiconducting ribbons depends on the flow rate of the carrier gas
			and the position of the substrate in the interaction tube. The optimal
			conditions for DSVA produce a semiconducting layer with well-aligned and
			interconnected ribbons. Such a layer leads to a high performance of the
			OFETs, suggesting that DSVA is a versatile technique for solution
			processing of organic semiconductors.

			<p><strong>Background and Problem Statement</strong></p>
		</div>
		<h1 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h1>
		<p>
			The escalating global issue of electronic waste demands a shift towards
			sustainable alternatives. While high performance organic electronics
			particularly Organic Field-Effect Transistors(OFETs) show promise, their
			performance is still not at par with traditional inorganic electronics.
			The task that needs to be undertaken is that we need to seamlessly
			integrate high performance and eco-friendliness while navigating through
			complex procedures such as material selection and fabrication processes
			and produce OFETs that are air-stable and biodegradable in nature.
		</p>
		<p>
			One Technique that is used to create OFETs is drop casting the organic
			semiconductor on your substrates however even though this technique has
			shown promise but this technique doesn’t take into account the need for
			alignment of crystals or the elongation of crystals. Hence another novel
			technique can be used post drop-casting that uses Directional Solvent
			Vapor Annealing or DSVA. However, since DSVA is a novel technique and
			there is lack of research on several parameters that may or may not affect
			the techniques’ outcomes. So, there is a need for a parameter optimization
			study that varies several relevant parameters and reports the outcomes.
		</p>
		<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
		<p>
			Organic semiconductor solution-processing methods are gaining attention
			for their cheaper production costs and eco-friendly nature, aiming to
			compete with complex vacuum processing techniques. Factors influencing the
			performance of solution-processed devices include crystallinity, molecular
			packing, morphology, and orientation of crystalline domains. The main
			challenge in solution-processed semiconductors arises from
			three-dimensional crystal growth, leading to inconsistent charge transport
			and device behavior.
		</p>
		<p>
			Common methods like drop casting and spin coating present a trade-off
			between molecular settlement time and crystallinity, impacting uniformity
			and consistency in device performance. Alternative processing and
			post-processing methods, such as zone casting, dip coating, and inkjet
			printing, have been explored to control molecular self-assembly and
			enhance crystalline order. Incorporating post-processing methods like
			solvent vapor annealing (SVA) has proven advantageous for improving
			self-organization and crystalline order in semiconductor films.
		</p>
		<p>
			The proposed directional solvent vapor annealing (DSVA) integrates
			deposition and post-processing, aiming to achieve highly aligned and
			crystalline films for high-performance organic semiconductor devices. DSVA
			involves the flow of a carrier gas and solvent vapors in a specific
			direction and proximity to the substrate, promoting macroscopic alignment
			and microscopic molecular self-assembly in crystalline domains.
		</p>
		<p>
			Parameters like carrier gas flow rate, substrate proximity, and position
			in the interaction tube critically affect overall crystallinity,
			alignment, and device performance. DSVA application in organic
			field-effect transistors (OFETs) fabrication demonstrated a maximum
			mobility of
			<span class="math inline"
				>\(0.86 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{V} \cdot \text{s}\)</span
			>
			and a high current on-off ratio of
			<span class="math inline">\(10^6\)</span>, showcasing its potential for
			achieving high-performance devices in solution-processed organic
			semiconductors.

		<p>
			The experimental setup was in dysfunctional state at the start of the
			project and hence required tune-up and testing for any malfunction that
			may have been caused due to the apparatus being unused for a long time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, There were some issues regarding the cleaning of the apparatus as
			the glass vessel that rests on a hot plate has no big enough opening for a
			proper cleaning and the adhesive did not interact well with Iso-propyl
			alcohol and seem to disintegrate on contact. So another way was employed
			as toluene was used under a fume hood and then heated and vapours were
			allowed to flow from inside the glass vessel to the rest of the apparatus
			hence cleaning the entire apparatus. These are pictures of the final
			apparatus.

			A lot of parameters were discussed and pondered upon, finally coming up

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Height of the tube ceiling with respect to the floor of the stage</p>

		<h2 id="some-preliminary-experiments">Some Preliminary Experiments</h2>
		<p>
			There were some basic questions that arose during the project and some
			basic preliminary experiments without much experimental setup were
			designed to answer those questions.
		</p>
		<p>
			There was one experiment where 2 samples of ITO-PET substrate were taken
			after proper cleaning process and then through Atomic Layer Deposition
			(ALD) Hafnium was deposited on only one of them and then
			6,13-Bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene also known as TIPS-Pentacene
			was drop-casted on both those samples.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then to simulate something like DSVA, Nitrogen gas was passed over the
			samples and to prevent direct flow of the gas over the samples a simple
			cardboard piece was placed. The inferences from the experiment included
			that the only the flow of gas without solvent vapors was not responsible
			for the crystal formation and Hafnium provided better crystallinity as
			compared to sample without Hafnium.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another Experiment was conducted and this experiment included two samples
			based on ITO-PET and one was coated Polystyrene(PS) and then
			TIPS-Pentacene was drop casted on it. And another sample which was
			drop-casted with a pre mixed TIPS-Pentacene and Polystyrene solution in
			Toluene. The sample that was coated with Polystyrene and then
			TIPS-Pentacene showed better crystallinity however the electrical
			characteristics were not tested. In an ideal scenario the TIPS-Pentacene
			and PS mix should have shown phase separation during crystal formation.

		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					The substrate ITO-PET isn’t hydrophilic enough to hold our solution in
					a stable form in front of the Nitrogen gas. So, some more surface
					treatment needs to be done to the ITO-PET for better attraction
					towards the solution.The non-uniform film cause short circuits.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The Factor Mixing Ratio has an effect on the quality of the film
					higher concentration provided better quality film with uniform
					crystals and in the end relatively better performance.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The Factor Incline didn’t have a positive effect instead resulted in
					accumulation of the solution at the bottom end not being able to form
					a film on the the sample apart from the very bottom
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The Factor Substrate Material Does have an effect as the interactions
					with solution and hydrophobicity of every substrate is different and
					surface treatments also make a difference.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					In respect to prior testing with the apparatus in the original paper
					we know that height of tube ceiling with respect to the floor of the
					stage,Distance of the midpoint of the sample from the beginning of the
					interaction tube, Flow rate of the carrier gas,
